``pyramid_debugtoolbar``
=======================

``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` provides a debug toolbar useful while you're
developing your Pyramid application.

.. warning:: This code requires the Pyramid trunk; no released version of
   Pyramid (e.g. 1.0 or 1.1) will run it.

Note that ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` is a blatant rip-off of Michael van
Telligen's ``flask-debugtoolbar`` (which itself was ripped off from Rob
Hudson's ``django-debugtoolbar``).  It also includes a lightly sanded down
version of the Werkzeug debugger code by Armin Ronacher and team.
