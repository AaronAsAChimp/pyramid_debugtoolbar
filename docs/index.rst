pyramid_debugtoolbar
====================

Overview
--------

``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` provides a debug toolbar useful while you're
developing a :term:`Pyramid` application.

Note that :mod:`pyramid_debugtoolbar` is a blatant rip-off of Michael van
Telligen's ``flask-debugtoolbar`` (which itself was ripped off from Rob
Hudson's ``django-debugtoolbar``).

Installation
------------

Install using setuptools, e.g. (within a virtualenv)::

  $ easy_install pyramid_debugtoolbar

Setup
-----

Once ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` is installed, you must use the
``config.include`` mechanism to include it into your Pyramid project's
configuration.  In your Pyramid project's ``__init__.py``:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   config = Configurator(.....)
   config.include('pyramid_debugtoolbar')

From now on, whenever a response is generated by Pyramid, it will include the
debug_toolbar if the ``REMOTE_ADDR`` of the incoming request matches an IP
address of the local host.
